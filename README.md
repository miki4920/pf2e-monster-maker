# fvtt-module-pf2e-MonsterMaker
A Foundry VTT module designed for Pathfinder 2E System, that allows you to create combat NPCs from scratch, using values from the Pathfinder 2e Building Creatures Guide: https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995

To use the Monster Maker, you have to create a blank NPC. Using a non-blank sheet is possible, but DCs and other special abilities will not scale. 

When you open its Character Sheet, you can find a button at the top. Clicking this button will open the monster builder.
In there, you either use one of the roadmaps, allowing you to set values automatically for a given monster type, or you could create your unique creature by changing any of the drop-down menus.

By default, all values are moderate, meaning you will get a creature that does not possess strengths or weaknesses. If you are planning to use your values rather than roadmaps, please take a look at the Creature Building Guide to see how to create a balanced monster: https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995. Whenever you give a monster a strength, don't forget to give it a weakness to compensate. When you are happy with your values for the monster, click the "Submit" button. This will override the current values on the sheet.

Below are the images of the form:
First part contains all of the important values like Hit Points, Level, Name etc.
The Second part contains all of the skills as well as the Submit Button
